# Welcome to the repository of 480's Charts
Here you will find charts of songs I charted over time.

It's recommended to use [JS Engine](https://github.com/JordanSantiagoYT/FNF-JS-Engine) to play these charts the way I intended it to be. You can also use [Psych Engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine), and maybe even it's [forks](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine/forks).
